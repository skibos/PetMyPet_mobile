# PetMyPet mobile frontend

It's a prototype of a frontend app that I was working on with my team as a project for university. I was using React Native with Expo.

Our goal was creating an app for both the hotel owners and users.
For the user, the main features are: the creation of accounts and the assignment of their pets to it, browsing through offers and making reservations.
The features of the hotel owner would be: accept/reject bookings, manage the hotel profile and set service-free days for a specific type of pet.

Couple of screenshots from app:<br/>

Splash screen, login screen and screen with list of hotels (available after and before login to the app)<br/><br/>
