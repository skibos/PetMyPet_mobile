# PetMyPet mobile frontend

It's a prototype of a frontend app that I'm currently working on with my team. I'm using React Native with Expo. It's not yet finished.

Our goal is creating an app for both the hotel owners and users.
For the user, the main features are: the creation of accounts and the assignment of their pets to it, browsing through offers and making reservations.
The features of the hotel owner would be: accept/reject bookings, manage the hotel profile and set service-free days for a specific type of pet.
